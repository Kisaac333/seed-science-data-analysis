# Phase 1 – Intro to Descriptive Statistics in Seed Science

This module analyzes seed germination performance under increasing salinity stress using a CRD (Completely Randomized Design) experimental layout.

## Objectives
- Load, clean, and summarize seed germination data in R.
- Calculate germination percentage and basic stats (mean, SD, SE, CV).
- Visualize treatment effects using boxplots.
- Write clean and reproducible RMarkdown code.
- Interpret biological significance of the results.

## Files
- `datasets/seed_germination_stress.csv` – dataset on seed germination under salinity levels.
- `analysis/germination_analysis.Rmd` – RMarkdown file for data analysis and visualizations.

## Tools Used
- R + RStudio
- `tidyverse` for data manipulation and plotting

## Context
Seed enhancement under saline conditions is crucial for arid zone agriculture. This analysis provides insight into how salt stress affects germination, laying the foundation for further work on seed pelleting and microbial treatments.
